            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Interview: Artist Ryan McGinness on Designing for Hennessy</h1><p>Despite the fact that he works across multiple artistic mediums, it's very easy to discern the work of NYC-based artist Ryan McGinness. In addition to his iconic symbol-driven body of work, his experimental Instagram and the depths of his oftentimes ornate paintings, McGinness recently took to designing a special limited edition bottle for luxury cognac brand Hennessy.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b0177dec01e85895d69f554c2d73fc2a73857261.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light painting with pixelstick</h1><p>More info at thepixelstick.com! We spent the last year building pixelstick, a light painting tool capable of everything from photo-real renders to amazing abstract ribbons. We've improved with every iteration and are excited to finally show off what it can do. Everything was shot by just two slightly sleep deprived guys and one Pixelstick in Brooklyn.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f83450408b8ae969aa617e22dc894484/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F481060213_1280x720.jpg"></article>]]></description>
